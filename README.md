###Deprecated. NOT work on reobfuscated class `AbstractClientPlayer`

###Universal Skin MOD
This is a Coremod for Minecraft.
It loads the URLs in the configure file and test them if they are available for current user.
It will automatically add Mojang's official skin server so you don't need to add that.
###Still Under Development
Works under a development environment but somehow can't work under an obfuscated environment.
And it will take long time to check all the URLs when loading a world if you added too many URLs.
